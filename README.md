# Distribution_Shifts

This repository contains the code we used to develop our framework to tackle covariate shift in Deep Learning. 

We have used TensorFlow Datasets to be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#image_classification

This is a work in progress for a research project.
